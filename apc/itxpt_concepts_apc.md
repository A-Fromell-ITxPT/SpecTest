**COMPOUND TRAIN** - A VEHICLE TYPE composed of a sequence of more than one vehicles of the type TRAIN.

**ENTRANCE FOR PASSENGER SPACE** - A PASSENGER ENTRANCE used as an entry- and/or exit- point to or from a certain PASSENGER SPACE along with information if the designated exit and entry directions of the PASSENGER ENTRANCE are aligned or reversed in relation to the PASSENGER SPACE.

**PASSENGER ENTRANCE** - A physical or virtual boundary point through which passengers can enter or exit, e.g. a vehicle door. A PASSENGER ENTRANCE has a designated enter-direction and a designated exit-direction.

**PASSENGER ENTRANCE COUNT** - Number of passengers and other objects that have entered and exited through a specific PASSENGER ENTRANCE during a time span or since some implicit or explicit previous time/event. A possible implementation of LOGGABLE OBJECT.

**PASSENGER SPACE** - A passenger area within a VEHICLE. It may be limited to only a part of a VEHICLE such as a TRAIN ELEMENT, upper deck/lower deck, first class compartment or a bounded open space. A PASSENGER SPACE can be part of, overlap with, and be made up of other PASSENGER SPACEs.

**PASSENGER SPACE CAPACITY** - The number of passengers and other objects that are present in a PASSENGER SPACE when it is at 100% capacity.

**PASSENGER SPACE ENTRANCE COUNT** - Number of passengers and other objects that entered and exited a specific PASSENGER SPACE during a time span or since some implicit or explicit previous time/event. A possible implementation of LOGGABLE OBJECT. It is in essence an aggregation of relevant PASSENGER ENTRANCE COUNTs according to ENTRANCE FOR PASSENGER SPACE information.

**PASSENGER SPACE OCCUPANCY COUNT** - Number of passengers and other objects that are in a PASSENGER SPACE at a given time. A possible implementation of LOGGABLE OBJECT.

**TRAIN** - A VEHICLE TYPE composed of TRAIN ELEMENTs in a certain order, i.e. of wagons assembled together and propelled by a locomotive or one of the wagons.

**TRAIN ELEMENT** - An elementary component of a TRAIN (e.g. wagon, locomotive).
