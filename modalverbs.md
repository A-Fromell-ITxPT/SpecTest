=======================

In the present document \"**shall**\", \"**shall not**\",
\"**should**\", \"**should not**\", \"**may**\", \"**need not**\",
\"**will\"**, **\"will not\"**, \"**can**\" and \"**cannot**\" are to be
interpreted as described below.

\"**must**\" and \"**must not**\" are **NOT** allowed in ITxPT
deliverables except when used in direct citation.

In order to be able to claim compliance with an ITXPT deliverable, the
user needs to be able to identify the requirements that are obligatory.
The user also needs to be able to distinguish these requirements from
other provisions where there is a certain freedom of choice.

This clause is clearly stating the verbal form that shall be used to
express a particular kind of provision, i.e. a requirement, a
recommendation or a permission.

In the first column of tables T1 to T4 the verbal form that shall be
used to express each kind of provision is given. The equivalent
expressions given in the second column may be used only in exceptional
cases when the form given in the first column cannot be used for
linguistic reasons

NOTE: Only singular forms are shown.

The verbal forms shown in Table T1 shall be used to indicate
**requirements** strictly to be followed in order to conform to the
standard and from which no deviation is permitted. For example, the
requirements to be followed may relate to values, actions, features to
be supported and/or used or presence/absence or optional elements.
